# CPO
## Corrected Proportion of Occurrences

This tool calculates the corrected cooccurrence index (CPO) between pairs of species based in a collection of ecological samples.  



CPO is calculated as:

CPO = n~it~ 

where nij is the number of samples where species i cooccurred with species j; ni is the total number of samples where species i occurred; nj is the number of samples where species j cooccurred; and N is the total number of samples. The CPOit indicates whether species i co-occurred more (CPOit > 1) or less (CPOit < 1) than expected by chance (CPOit = 1) with species j.
